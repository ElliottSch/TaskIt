* Go To MLabs.com and register to get a free AWS Database or upgrade your plan if needed
* Once you register an account you can create a DB. Once created go to the Users tab
and create a user and password
* This will be used as your mongoURI to connect the api

* Please use the default address and update with the appropriate username and password between the '<' and '>'

* Example:
mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds161794.mlab.com:61794/taskit

* To connect using the mongo shell:
% mongo ds161794.mlab.com:61794/taskit -u <dbuser> -p <dbpassword>
